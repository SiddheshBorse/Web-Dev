        <div><b>Cuttlefish</b> or <b>cuttles <sup>[2]</sup></b> are marine molluscs of the order Sepiida. They belong to
            the
            class
            Cephalopoda, which also
            includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which is
            used for
            control of buoyancy.
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated
                suckers,
                with which
                they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest
                species, Sepia
                apama, reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.<sup>[3]</sup></p>

            <h2>Fossil Record</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The earliest fossils of cuttlefish are from the Cretaceous period.[6][7] represented by Ceratisepia from
                the
                Late
                Maastrichtian-Paleocene.[8] Whether the earlier Trachyteuthis is assigned to this order, or to the
                Octopodiformes,
                remains unclear.[9]</p>

            <h2>Range and habitat</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and temperate ocean waters. They
                are
                mostly
                shallow-water animals, although they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).[10] They have
                an
                unusual
                biogeographic pattern; they are present along the coasts of East and South Asia, Western Europe, and the
                Mediterranean,
                as well as all coasts of Africa and Australia, but are totally absent from the Americas. By the time the
                family evolved,
                ostensibly in the Old World, the North Atlantic possibly had become too cold and deep for these
                warm-water
                species to
                cross.[11] The common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), is found in the Mediterranean, North and Baltic
                seas,
                although
                populations may occur as far south as South Africa. They are found in sublittoral depths, between the
                low
                tide line and
                the edge of the continental shelf, to about 180 m (600 ft).[12] The cuttlefish is listed under the Red
                List
                category of
                "least concern" by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This means that while some over-exploitation
                of
                the marine
                animal has occurred in some regions due to large-scale commercial fishing, their wide geographic range
                prevents them
                from being too threatened. Ocean acidification, however, caused largely by higher levels of carbon
                dioxide
                emitted into
                the atmosphere, is cited as a potential threat.[13]</p>

            <h2>Anatomy and physiology</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Visual system</h3>
            <p>Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The organogenesis and the final structure of
                the
                cephalopod
                eye fundamentally differ from those of vertebrates such as humans.[14] Superficial similarities between
                cephalopod and
                vertebrate eyes are thought to be examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil is a smoothly
                curving
                W-shape.[15][16] Although cuttlefish cannot see color,[17] they can perceive the polarization of light,
                which enhances
                their perception of contrast. They have two spots of concentrated sensor cells on their retinas (known
                as
                foveae), one
                to look more forward, and one to look more backward. The eye changes focus by shifting the position of
                the
                entire lens
                with respect to the retina, instead of reshaping the lens as in mammals. Unlike the vertebrate eye, no
                blind
                spot
                exists, because the optic nerve is positioned behind the retina. They are capable of using stereopsis,
                enabling them to
                discern depth/distance because their brain calculates the input from both eyes.[18][19]</p>
            <h3>Circulatory system</h3>
            <p>The blood of a cuttlefish is an unusual shade of green-blue, because it uses the copper-containing
                protein
                haemocyanin
                to carry oxygen instead of the red, iron-containing protein haemoglobin found in vertebrates' blood. The
                blood is pumped
                by three separate hearts: two branchial hearts pump blood to the cuttlefish's pair of gills (one heart
                for
                each), and
                the third pumps blood around the rest of the body. Cuttlefish blood must flow more rapidly than that of
                most
                other
                animals because haemocyanin carries substantially less oxygen than haemoglobin. Unlike most other
                mollusks,
                cephalopods
                like cuttlefish have a closed circulatory system.[citation needed]</p>

            <h2>Communication</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Cephalopods are able to communicate visually using a diverse range of signals. To produce these signals,
                cephalopods can
                vary four types of communication element: chromatic (skin coloration), skin texture (e.g. rough or
                smooth), posture, and
                locomotion. Changes in body appearance such as these are sometimes called polyphenism. The common
                cuttlefish can display
                34 chromatic, six textural, eight postural and six locomotor elements, whereas flamboyant cuttlefish use
                between 42 and
                75 chromatic, 14 postural, and seven textural and locomotor elements. The Caribbean reef squid
                (Sepioteuthis sepioidea)
                is thought to have up to 35 distinct signalling states.[39][40]</p>
